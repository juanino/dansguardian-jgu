== Dansguardian config for kids
My own personal mess.
Some files duplicated and in wrong spots because dansguardian or distribution
versions changed.
The settings are safe for younger kids, but have some minor whitelists for things like itunes and microsoft updates.

== Dsitribution info
This is a config from debian 6.0.5 but should work with any distro.
The DG version is 2.10.1.1-3 in debian 6.0.5 that I am using.
